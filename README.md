# MNIST-Recongnition
First Machine Learning project worked on, followed a tutorial https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/ 
but specifcially focused on understanding the code and HOW & WHY it works to grasp a strong beginning to Machine learning and Neural Networks


Current Accuracy of 97% at predicting hand written digits provided by the MNIST data set
